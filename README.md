## NCAA Men's Basketball Ratings for 2016

This is a last-minute thing I put together to try to rate teams using the Elo rating system so I can fill out my bracket.

The source data I used is from [Massey Ratings](http://www.masseyratings.com/scores.php?s=284067&sub=284067&all=1) and [Spreadsheet Sports](https://www.spreadsheet-sports.com/2015-ncaa-basketball-game-data).

### Data Format for Massey Ratings

CSV file with the following fields:
- days since 1-1-0000
- YYYYMMDD
- team1 index (zero if a non-conference team)
- homefield1 (1=home, -1=away, 0=neutral)
- score1
- team2 index (zero if a non-conference team)
- homefield2 (1=home, -1=away, 0=neutral)
- score2
